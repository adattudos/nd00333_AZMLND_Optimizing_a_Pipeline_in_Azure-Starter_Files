# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary
The data is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a bank term deposit.
The best performing model was a VotingEnsemble AutoML model.

## Scikit-learn Pipeline
- Training of a Logistic Regression model is implemented in train.py including dataset cleaning
- Data is accessed through Dataset created by TabularDatasetFactory from delimited csv files in train.py
- Random Parameter Sampling is used for HyperDrive based hyperparameter tuning of C (inverse regularization strength) and max iterations enabling a quick search in the hyperparameter space  
- Early stopping Bandit Policiy ensures that any run that doesn't fall within the slack factor or slack amount of the evaluation metric with respect to the best performing run will be terminated

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison
The relatively simple Scikit-learn binary logistic model has achieved good performance despite the linear relationship between the predictor variables and the log odds of the event that y=1. The more advanced best VotingEnsemble AutoML model has achieved slightly better accuracy of 0.916 vs 0.910 of Logistic Regression. 

## Future work
Potential future improvements include but are not limited to:
- Addressing class imbalance in training data set
- Hyperparameter tuning of the best model
- Exploring feature importance
- Training models longer or on larger cluster
